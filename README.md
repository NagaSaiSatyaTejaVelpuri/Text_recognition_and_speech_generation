# Text_recognition_and_speech_generation
This project is an attempt to help visually impaired people to read digital content and other non Braille scripts. 
In this project we will be using pytesseract and tesseract OCR to fetch text from an image and then pass the recognised text into a 
gTTS engine which will help us convert the text into speech.

### Dependencies:
1. Pytesseract
2. Tesseract OCR
3. gTTS 

### NOTE:
If you wish to use colab as your ide, then all the installations will be done automatically after you upload the .ipynb file and run it.
Else you can also run this code via any other .py ide such as spyder. But you'll have to setup your environment manually.

### Installation of dependencies (For manual installation):
1. Install pytesseract using anaconda prompt
"pip install pytesseract"
2.  Install gTTS using anaconda prompt
"pip install gTTS"
3.  Download tesseract executible file from: 
"https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki"
4.  Run that 'tesseract________.exe' file and install.
